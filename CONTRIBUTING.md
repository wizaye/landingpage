### Keeping Your Branch Up-to-Date

Please ensure your local branch is **synced with the latest  `develop` branch** before making changes or opening a Pull Request (PR).  
This helps avoid unnecessary merge conflicts and ensures a smooth review process.

⚠️**Note**:
- 🚀 Please raise PRs **only to the `develop` branch**.  
- 📷 For faster reviews and merges, include a **recording or screenshot** (depending on the issue) that demonstrates the fix.  
- 🏗️ Before opening a PR, run `npm run build` and ensure the project builds successfully **without errors**.  
- ✅ Only raise a PR once the build passes.  
- 🔗 When raising the PR, please **reference the issue number** it addresses.  


### Merge Conflicts

- Project maintainers are **not responsible** if your PR is blocked due to merge conflicts.  
- It is **your responsibility** to update your branch and resolve conflicts before requesting a merge.
